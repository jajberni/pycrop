pycrop
=================

PyCrop is a python toolbox for basic crop physiology modeling. The aim is to provide energy balance functions in order to estimate canopy conductance and crop water stress index from canopy temperature and micrometheorological measurements. 

It is based on Berni et al. (2009) paper [Mapping canopy conductance and CWSI in olive orchards using high resolution thermal remote sensing imagery](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2009.06.018)
